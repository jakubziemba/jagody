**A website for a berry farm.**

Jagodajnia is a Haskap berry farm near Nysa, Poland. The client asked for a website with information about the farm, articles, gallery and contact form.

After getting the content from the client, I created a simple website with a bit of animation to make it look alive and playful.

For this project I used React (Gatsby) with Styled Components and Framer Motion. FlexyForm takes care of the backend of the contact form. The website is also connected to Prismic CMS for easier content management.
